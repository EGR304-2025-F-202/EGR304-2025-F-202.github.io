The goal is to make life easier by using simple sensors in useful ways. For this project, we are building a smart trash can that improves how people manage waste at home.

Some might detect motion to open the lid, others might track fill level, manage odor control, or help with bag replacement. When we connect all the parts, we\u2019ll have a working product that makes trash disposal cleaner and more convenient.

Plus, Debra no longer has to guess when the bag is full because a little light lets her know so she never ends up overfilling it.</p> <p>She does not worry about confusing technology because the trash can is easy to use and does not need a phone app. It just works.

Safety and comfort followed, as they influence daily trust and usability, while notifications and connectivity were placed mid-level because they enhance convenience but are less critical than core performance. Energy efficiency, sustainability, portability, and storage were positioned lower, as they add value but are not dealbreakers for most users. Finally, advanced experimental functions and aesthetic design features were ranked last, since they serve more as factors differentiating our product from others or as enhancements rather than essential needs. This approach ensures that the most important issues are addressed first, while still leaving room for innovation and lifestyle improvements.</p>"},{"location":"05-design-ideation/#concept-designs","title":"Concept Designs","text":""},{"location":"05-design-ideation/#one-page-discussion","title":"One-page Discussion","text":"<p>During our brainstorming session for the smart trash can project, our team, Damian, Lia, Vedaa, and Mohammed, met mainly through Zoom, but also had discussions through group chats when we needed to continue discussing outside of live meetings. These methods of communication allowed everyone to contribute according to their availability and ensured that our conversations were able to keep going beyond zoom.</p> <p>The process began with a general discussion of the project assignment, where we reviewed the specific requirements provided to us. Each team member contributed their own interpretation of what the assignment was asking for, and from there, we started generating initial ideas. To expand our pool of options, we used several sources: brainstorming aloud during Zoom calls, conducting quick searches on Google to see what kinds of smart trash cans or similar products already existed, and browsing online marketplaces like Amazon for inspiration. These resources helped us see what features are already on the market, as well as gaps that could be improved upon.</p> <p>We collected ideas in real time, with each team member acting as a note-taker by writing down ideas on a Google Doc during Zoom meetings while others contributed suggestions. The notes were later shared with the group so everyone could verify and refine what had been written. Because we also brainstormed over text, some ideas were collected asynchronously, which allowed team members to think and refine their ideas more carefully before contributing. This helped balance out the group dynamic. Once we had a long list of features and concepts, we began grouping them into broader categories. For example, ideas related to health and cleanliness were grouped under Hygiene &amp; Odor Control, while concepts involving app connectivity or smart sensors fell under Connectivity &amp; Smart Features. This categorization made it easier to see where our priorities lay and how different ideas fit together.</p> <p>Finally, we used a ranking system to prioritize which categories and features should take precedence in our design. We agreed on a scale from 1 to 10, with 1 representing the most important features and 10 the least important. The final rankings were: (1) Hygiene &amp; Odor Control, (2) Reliability &amp; Longevity, (3) Ease of Use &amp; Convenience, (4) Safety &amp; Comfort, (5) Notifications &amp; Feedback, (6) Connectivity &amp; Smart Features, (7) Energy &amp; Sustainability, (8) Portability &amp; Storage, (9) Advanced/Experimental, and (10) Aesthetic &amp; Lifestyle. This system gave us a clear framework for decision-making and ensured that our design process would focus on the features most critical to user needs while still leaving room for innovation and customization.</p>"},{"location":"06-team-block-diagram/","title":"Team Block Diagram","text":""},{"location":"06-team-block-diagram/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>Bold Text Italic Text Bold and Italic Text</p>"},{"location":"06-team-block-diagram/#research-question","title":"Research Question","text":"<ul> <li>Bullet Point 1</li> <li>Bullet Point 2</li> <li>Bullet Point 3</li> </ul>"},{"location":"06-team-block-diagram/#images","title":"Images","text":"<p> Figure 2: Early PCB working design</p> <p> Figure 3: Innovation Showcase Spring '25, where the products were a STEM-themed display that demonstrates a single scientific/engineering concept with the intended user of K-12 students interested in learning about science, technology, engineering, or math.</p>"},{"location":"06-team-block-diagram/#results","title":"Results","text":"<ol> <li>Numbered Point 1</li> <li>Numbered Point 2</li> <li>Numbered Point 3</li> </ol>"},{"location":"06-team-block-diagram/#conclusions-and-future-work","title":"Conclusions and Future Work","text":""},{"location":"06-team-block-diagram/#external-links","title":"External Links","text":"<p>example link to idealab</p>"},{"location":"06-team-block-diagram/#results_1","title":"Results","text":"<ol> <li>Numbered Point 1</li> <li>Numbered Point 2</li> <li>Numbered Point 3</li> </ol>"},{"location":"06-team-block-diagram/#conclusions-and-future-work_1","title":"Conclusions and Future Work","text":""},{"location":"06-team-block-diagram/#external-links_1","title":"External Links","text":"<p>example link to idealab</p>"},{"location":"06-team-block-diagram/#references","title":"References","text":""},{"location":"07-Software%20Proposal/","title":"Software Proposal","text":""},{"location":"07-Software%20Proposal/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>Bold Text Italic Text Bold and Italic Text</p>"},{"location":"07-Software%20Proposal/#research-question","title":"Research Question","text":"<ul> <li>Bullet Point 1</li> <li>Bullet Point 2</li> <li>Bullet Point 3</li> </ul>"},{"location":"07-Software%20Proposal/#images","title":"Images","text":"<p> Figure 2: Early PCB working design</p> <p> Figure 3: Innovation Showcase Spring '25, where the products were a STEM-themed display that demonstrates a single scientific/engineering concept with the intended user of K-12 students interested in learning about science, technology, engineering, or math.</p>"},{"location":"07-Software%20Proposal/#results","title":"Results","text":"<ol> <li>Numbered Point 1</li> <li>Numbered Point 2</li> <li>Numbered Point 3</li> </ol>"},{"location":"07-Software%20Proposal/#conclusions-and-future-work","title":"Conclusions and Future Work","text":""},{"location":"07-Software%20Proposal/#external-links","title":"External Links","text":"<p>example link to idealab</p>"},{"location":"07-Software%20Proposal/#results_1","title":"Results","text":"<ol> <li>Numbered Point 1</li> <li>Numbered Point 2</li> <li>Numbered Point 3</li> </ol>"},{"location":"07-Software%20Proposal/#conclusions-and-future-work_1","title":"Conclusions and Future Work","text":""},{"location":"07-Software%20Proposal/#external-links_1","title":"External Links","text":"<p>example link to idealab</p>"},{"location":"07-Software%20Proposal/#references","title":"References","text":""},{"location":"08-Block%20Diagram%2C%20Process%20Diagram%2C%20and%20Message%20Structure/","title":"Block Diagram, Process Diagram, and Message Structure","text":"<p>Vedaa UbaleMicrochip PIC18F57Q43 Curiosity NanoButton 1H-BridgeTexas Instruments DRV8871MotorPololu\u00a037D 12VADC1RA0Digital I/ORA1RB2RC4RD0RD1PWMRA2Red LEDDistance sensorMaxBotixMB7066 XL-MaxSonar-WROp AmpMicrochip TechnologyMCP6004-I/Pconnector 1digitalanalog12345678connector 2digitalanalog12345678Block Diagram -- Team 202: AutocanMember Lia Ryan, Vedaa Ubale, Damien Novgorodov, Mohammed Ali D AlqarniLia -
