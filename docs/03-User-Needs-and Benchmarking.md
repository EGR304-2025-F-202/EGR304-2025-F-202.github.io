## What are we trying to accomplish?

We are trying to build a smart trash system that will help users use their trash can hands free, while sealing in the smells and preventing flies or other insects from getting into the trash. We also want to notify users when the trash can is full without opening the lid and when the trash is almost too heavy for a normal trash bag to handle. 


## What is the community we are trying to serve?

We are trying to serve those who have a hard time opening a trash can lid and throwing trash in with the other, such as elderly people or busy parents. We also want to prevent food waste from sitting in the can for too long to start rotting and attracting flies.

## Evolution of the User Needs and Benchmarking Process

The user needs development began with benchmarking five existing smart trash cans (Vanpopubs, EKO, iTouchless, Best Office, and Ninestars) using verified Amazon customer reviews as the primary Voice of Customer (VOC) source. From these reviews, explicit needs were identified directly from user statements, while latent needs were inferred from repeated complaints, satisfaction patterns, and implied expectations.  

Using this VOC data, a total of 100 initial user needs were generated to fully capture user expectations related to reliability, hygiene, ease of use, portability, safety, and cost. These needs were then grouped into six major priority categories to reduce redundancy and clarify system-level design goals. Finally, the groups were ranked based on safety impact, frequency of appearance in customer feedback, and relevance to the target user community (elderly users, busy parents, and households concerned with cleanliness and pests). This ranked and grouped list of 100 user needs now serves as the foundation for all design decisions in the smart trash system.
