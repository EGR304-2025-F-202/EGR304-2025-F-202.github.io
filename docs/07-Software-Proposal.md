## Introduction

In order to display how our subsystems work togther on the software level, we have created a State Machine Diagram including all of our subsystems. Below in Figure 1 is our state machine diagram for the Autocan that uses activity state blocks and action arrows to show how our code will flow when turning on the device and using it.
