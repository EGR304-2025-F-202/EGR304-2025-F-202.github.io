## Team Charter

Our team is working on a smart home project. The goal is to make life easier by using simple sensors in useful ways. For this project, we are building a smart trash can that improves how people manage waste at home. Each team member will design a PCB that handles a different part of the system. Some possible subsystems include motion detection for opening the lid, fill-level tracking, odor management, and helping with bag replacement. When we connect all the parts, we’ll have a working product that makes trash disposal cleaner and more convenient. Through EGR 304, we’ll get hands-on experience with the full process from brainstorming and design to building and testing a functional prototype.

## Product Mission Statement

We are building a smart trash can that helps people manage waste in a cleaner, safer, and more convenient way. It will use sensors to detect motion for hands-free use, monitor fill level, and check when the trash is getting too heavy. It will also help reduce odors and alert users when it’s time to take out the trash. The goal is to make everyday waste disposal easier and more hygienic.
