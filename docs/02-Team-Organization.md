## Team Charter


"Our design team will be designing and creating an automatic trash can that will make the daily lives of our customers easier and more comfortable. In the creation of our product, we will be using our company’s expertise in sensor design which was garnered in our previous product design experiences. We want to gain more experience at designing new products that break into existing markets that will lead to a successful sales number of 1000+ within the first year of launch. Throughout this project, our knowledge of the design we create and the PCBs we build will give investors incentive to invest with us over our market rivals, ultimately leading to our sales success and benefitting those who help us get there."


## Product Mission Statement

We are building a smart trash can that helps people manage waste in a cleaner, safer, and more convenient way. It will use sensors to detect motion for hands-free use, monitor fill level, and check when the trash is getting too heavy. It will also help reduce odors and alert users when it’s time to take out the trash. The goal is to make everyday waste disposal easier and more hygienic.
