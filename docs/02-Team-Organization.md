## Team Charter


"Our design team will be designing and creating an automatic trash can that will make the daily lives of our customers easier and more comfortable. In the creation of our product, we will be using our companyâ€™s expertise in sensor design which was garnered in our previous product design experiences. We want to gain more experience at designing new products that break into existing markets that will lead to a successful sales number of 1000+ within the first year of launch. Throughout this project, our knowledge of the design we create and the PCBs we build will give investors incentive to invest with us over our market rivals, ultimately leading to our sales success and benefitting those who help us get there."


## Product Mission Statement

The trash can that locks in smells and keeps out pets for the ease of the busy home owner.
