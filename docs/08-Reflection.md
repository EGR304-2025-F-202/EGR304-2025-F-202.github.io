# Reflection

## Lessons Learned

1. One of the most important lessons we learned is that clear and consistent communication is essential for successful teamwork, especially when managing a long-term design project with multiple components and deadlines.

2. Our team learned that early benchmarking and user research significantly improve design quality by grounding decisions in real user needs rather than assumptions.

3. We discovered that dividing responsibilities based on individual strengths improves efficiency and accountability across the team.

4. The design review feedback taught us the importance of documenting every step of the design process, not just the final result, so that our reasoning and progress are clear.

5. We learned that prototyping often reveals design flaws that are not initially obvious during the conceptual phase.

6. Time management became a critical skill as we balanced this project with other coursework and personal responsibilities.

7. Our team learned that iterative improvement leads to better outcomes than trying to achieve perfection on the first design attempt.

8. We realized that user safety and reliability must always be prioritized over cost reduction or convenience features.

9. We gained a stronger understanding of how engineering design is influenced by real-world constraints such as materials, power limitations, and durability requirements.

10. Finally, we learned that constructive feedback, even when critical, is necessary for growth and ultimately leads to stronger and more refined final designs.

## Recommendations for Future Students

1. Begin your benchmarking and user research as early as possible so your design decisions are supported by real customer feedback from the start.

2. Clearly define team roles during the first week of the project to avoid confusion and uneven workload distribution later.

3. Keep detailed documentation of every design decision, revision, and prototype change to simplify final reporting and justification.

4. Do not underestimate the time needed for testing and revisions, as most design improvements come from identifying and fixing unexpected problems.

5. Communicate frequently and address conflicts early to maintain a productive and respectful team working environment.
